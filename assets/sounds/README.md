Place short sound files here. Recommended filenames used by the app:
- assets/sounds/chime.mp3
- assets/sounds/bell.mp3
- assets/sounds/beep.mp3
- assets/sounds/melody.mp3
- assets/sounds/alarm.mp3

Use small (<= 1MB) MP3 files for best results. After adding files, run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
